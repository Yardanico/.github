# Yardanico ghost

This is not the previous account of Yardanico, just a preserve for those repos.

If you wonder where those repos goes, here is a list:

- Yardanico/nim-strenc -> https://github.com/nim-meta/strenc
- Yardanico/nimpylib -> https://github.com/nimpylib/pylib
- Yardanico/* -> [https://github.com/nimbackup/*](https://github.com/nimbackup/)

The old URLs cannot be directly restored due to [rule of github](https://github.blog/open-source/maintainers/new-tools-for-open-source-maintainers/#popular-repository-namespace-retirement)
